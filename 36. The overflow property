<p>
The Hufflepuff common room and dormitories are located in the Hufflepuff Basement. 
Students enter the Basement through a barrel in a stack of barrels in the kitchen corridor. 
They must tap the correct barrel in the rhythm of 'Helga Hufflepuff' for the lid to open and reveal 
the passageway to the common room. If someone taps the wrong barrel or uses the wrong rhythm, 
that person is drenched in vinegar.
