Hierarchy:
HTML is based off a hierarchy, that is HTML is the root element and then we have elements that are nested with inside HTML. 
So there's the body element and the head element and then there's elements that are nested within the body element and head element.
That is the hierarchy and what do you get with a hierarchy.

Overriding:
As shown below, p{color:brown;} now will override body{color:red;} and then the paragraph will be shown in brown.
Therefore, the inheritance only works if you don't have an identical rule in the child elements.

<style>

body{

color:red;

}

p{

color:brown;

font-size:25px;

font-family:Helvetica;

}

</style>
