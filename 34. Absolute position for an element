p{

div{

background-color: black;
color: white;

position: absolute;
top:75px;
right|left:150px;
width:250px;
height:250;

}



Notes:
The TOP property and LEFT|RIGHT property are the key locating property to specify the position.
It will ignore the other elements' position, even overlap them.

* The ABSOLUTE position elements are completely removed from the flow (float elements are outside of the flow).
