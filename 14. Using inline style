<p class="para1"> Welcome to the Fish Web Site. Everything you want to know about fish is in this web site. </p>

<p class="para2"> Bass fish live in lakes. The word for fish in Latin is <i>Pisces</i>. </p>

<p class="para3"> This is slanted text. </p>

Notes:
I want to point something out in terms of using inline style. 
You generally want to avoid using this unless and this is the key point, unless this is going to be rock solid.
This will never change these rules.
Now most websites eventually will change and that is why an external stylesheet is preferred because you can do it globally.
