            <p class="paragraph"> Megaladon was the largest shark ever found in the fossil record. It ruled the seas during it's heyday. 
            Megaladon may have reached up to 80 feet in length. The shark's bite force was greater than a T-Rex. </p>

Notes:
Here's the new html file (content page), and you can see we're going to be reusing hte same style.css that we've been 
using so that's more convenient. All of your future web pages can reuse the same style sheet.
